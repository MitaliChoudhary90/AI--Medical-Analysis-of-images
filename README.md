# 🧠 Medical Image Analysis AI (Streamlit + Google Gemini API)

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that integrates with **Google Gemini API** to demonstrate **AI-powered medical image analysis and text generation**.
The system is designed as an **experimental prototype** to explore how generative AI can assist in **detecting diseases** (such as cancer, cardiovascular issues, and neurological disorders) and generating **intelligent insights** from medical data.

## 🔐 API Key Security

⚠️ Your Google Gemini API key **must never be hardcoded in code**.
This project uses `.env` for secure key management.

## 📊 Use Case

This project is for **educational and research purposes only**.
It is **not a medical diagnostic tool** and should not replace professional medical advice.

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

* 📌 Upload and analyze medical images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans)
* 📌 Provide structured disease reports
* 📌 Improve model fine-tuning for healthcare datasets
